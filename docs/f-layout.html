            <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
            <p>
                The internet is a worldwide network that connects computers for the purpose of sharing information and
                communicating. It is also referred to as a twenty-first-century telephony. The internet, which dates
                back to the 1950s, has evolved swiftly and is now available to anyone with an internet service
                provider. In 1998, more emails were transmitted per day than first-class letters via the post office,
                accounting for 1/3 of the US economic growth. When computers were initially introduced, they were slow
                and the size of rooms. Over time, computers have become quicker and smaller, and they can now be used
                anywhere in the world.

            <p>
                J.C.R. Licklider was the individual who came up with the notion or "seed" of computers. During the civil
                war, the Advanced Research Project Agency, which managed the space program, which included computer
                science, began working on computers. Leonard Kleinrock began working on data transmission at MIT and is
                best known for queuing theory, an area of operations research with applications in a wide range of
                fields. He implemented two strategies: Demand access & Distributing control

                Robert Taylors' huge new idea in 1960 was time-sharing. Time-sharing is a technique of operation in
                which multiple users, each with their own software, interact with the main processing unit of a bigger
                digital computer. He sought to establish a network that would allow one terminal to communicate with all
                devices. He hired Lawrence Roberts to develop the first network after receiving the cash to work on it.
                In 1968, Larry assembled a team of engineers to create the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency
                Network), which is today known as the internet. This was built on Interface Message Processors, or IMPs,
                which were minicomputers or smaller computers, and a revolutionary technology called package switching.
                The intention was to connect identical IMPs, each of which would be connected to a different mainframe
                computer: Sigma 7 connected at UCLA, SDS 940 SRI connected at Stanford Research Institute, BM 360/75
                connected at University of California, PDP 10 connected at University of Utah.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ARPANET had 18 mainframe machines connected to it by April 1971. Emails and data were circulated
                throughout the network. The world-changing invention of Computer Networks was shown in Washington, DC in
                October 1972. Finally, a bill was approved by Congress that brought this out of the realm of exclusivity
                and into the public domain.
